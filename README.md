1-Description :
Hello, our main idea was to create an app that displays different medical and food centers available in Gaza and adds information about supplies, number of people and different kind of information, why? First, to gain time and know where to go directly without losing time searching for a place to go.
Second, for management, users can add all information about their medical or food centers for example number of medicines available, the type of medicine available, the quantity of food...

2-Our approach:
We taught about creating a static website. First, we have our home page, where you have three sections: medical centers, food centers and emergency numbers.
When we click on the medical center icon, a new page with a map will show up and display all the medical centers that users have added to it, When you click on one of them you will get all the information about it that users added
When we click on the food center icon, a new page with a map will show up that displays all the medical centers that users have added to it, When you click on one of them, you will get all the information about it that users added
On the Emergency Number section, users can add all emergency numbers Ex: ambulance number.
When the user clicks on the medical or food sender icon, we will ask him to share his localization if he wants ,and if he agrees the website will automatically display the nearest center.

3-What we need to add:
Now, the website isn’t complete; we need to add some JavaScript code for the different elements and a backend server that saves different information users add, we thought about a static website (the user needs to connect once to the internet and then all the information users add will be stored on the local storage of the browser “we don’t really know if it’s really doable”).
The website is only designed to work on phones now.

4-What we really wanted:
First of all, most of the members of our team are designers or beginner developers. Our main ideas (that we couldn’t implement because we didn’t have the skills to do the for now) were:
Making a phone app not a website, a phone app is way better to work offline than a website.
Making the app available only for people in Gaza territory
Adding multiple languages: English and Arabic.
Using a real map that we can add marks on it and not a static image.
Securing the app with a cybersecurity expert.
